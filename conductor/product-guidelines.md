# Product Guidelines

## 1. Prose and Communication Style

All documentation, commit messages, and in-code comments should be **technical and concise**. The goal is clarity and efficiency. Avoid conversational fluff and focus on communicating information directly and accurately.

## 2. Configuration and Code Style

### 2.1. Justification of Changes
All significant configurations, workarounds, or non-obvious code should be justified with in-code comments. These comments should be brief and explain the *why* behind the decision, not the *what*. This practice is crucial for long-term maintainability.

### 2.2. Nix Language Style
Follow the established conventions in the existing codebase. When in doubt, defer to the official `nixpkgs` style guides for formatting and structuring Nix expressions.

## 3. Visual and Theming Guidelines

The visual identity of this desktop configuration is **highly stylized and opinionated**. The aesthetic should be unique and cohesive, reflecting a specific theme or design philosophy. While function is important, the primary driver for visual choices is achieving a particular look and feel, even if it introduces complexity. Themes should be applied consistently across all visual components, from the window manager to the terminal and editor.
