# Spicetify

Spicetify is a command-line tool to customize the official Spotify client. It supports themes, extensions, and custom apps.
We use `spicetify-nix` to manage the configuration declaratively with Home Manager.

## Configuration

The configuration is located in `modules/hm/programs/media/spicetify.nix`.

```nix
modules.media.spicetify.enable = true;
```

### Features

- **Theme**: Catppuccin (Mocha)
- **Extensions**:
  - `adblock`: Blocks audio and banner ads.
  - `hidePodcasts`: Hides podcasts from the home screen.
  - `shuffle`: Proper shuffle functionality.
  - `popupLyrics`: Shows lyrics in a popup window.

## Usage

The configuration is applied automatically when you rebuild the system.

```bash
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hydenix
```

### Manual Control

Since it is managed by Nix, manual `spicetify` commands might be overwritten on the next build. However, you can still use the CLI for temporary changes or debugging.

```bash
spicetify apply
```
