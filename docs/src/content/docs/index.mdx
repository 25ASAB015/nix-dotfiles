# Hydenix User Manual

This manual is the single source of truth for working with this system. It is written for daily use and ongoing development.

## 1. Quick Start

### Common commands

```bash
make help
make test
make switch
```

### Recommended flow

```bash
make test
make switch
```

## 2. Repository structure

Top-level layout:

```
Dotfiles/
├── flake.nix
├── hosts/
├── modules/
├── resources/
├── Makefile
└── manual/
```

Where to look:

- `hosts/`: machine-specific configuration
- `modules/`: reusable NixOS and Home Manager modules
- `resources/`: mutable configs and scripts (edited directly)
- `manual/`: this manual

## 3. Hosts and machines

Hosts live under `hosts/`. Each host has:

- `configuration.nix`
- `user.nix`
- `hardware-configuration.nix` (generated)

Example switch:

```bash
make switch HOSTNAME=hydenix
```

## 4. Home Manager and modules

Home Manager is enabled in `hosts/hydenix/user.nix`. Custom modules are in `modules/hm`.

Key entry points:

- `modules/hm/default.nix` (imports all HM modules)
- `modules/system/` (system modules)

## 5. Mutable files (no rebuild after first apply)

Some configs are intended to be edited directly without rebuild:

- Keybinds: `resources/config/keybinds.conf`
- Scripts: `resources/scripts/*.sh`
- Kitty: `resources/config/kitty.conf`
- Monitors: `resources/config/monitors.conf`

After the first `make switch`, edits in `resources/` take effect immediately (no rebuild).

## 6. Keybinds and scripts

Main keybinds are defined in:

```
resources/config/keybinds.conf
```

Script launcher reads from:

```
resources/scripts/
```

## 7. Waybar

Waybar is managed by upstream Hydenix/HyDE. Local overrides are intentionally disabled to keep theme integration intact.

## 8. Network diagnostics

Use the built-in diagnostics target:

```bash
make test-network
```

## 9. Updating and maintenance

Update inputs:

```bash
make update
make test
make switch
```

Clean old generations:

```bash
make clean
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

Common steps:

```bash
make logs-errors
make test-network
make debug
```

## 11. Customization checklist

- Edit `resources/config/keybinds.conf`
- Add scripts in `resources/scripts/`
- Update terminal settings in `resources/config/kitty.conf`
- Update monitor layout in `resources/config/monitors.conf`

## 12. Glossary

- **Hydenix**: NixOS framework based on HyDE
- **HyDE**: upstream dotfiles for Hyprland
- **HM**: Home Manager
