### The Vision

This configuration delivers a **highly customized desktop experience** tailored for power users who enjoy system optimization, customization, and fine-tuning. Whether you're a developer working with AI tools, a system administrator managing multiple machines, or someone who simply values having granular control over their entire system setup, this configuration provides the foundation for a personal, optimized, and aesthetically pleasing environment.

### Built on Solid Foundations

The entire system is built using a **declarative approach** with the Nix ecosystem:

- **NixOS**: Reproducible and declarative system-wide configuration
- **Nix Flakes**: Ensures the exact same environment can be replicated anywhere
- **Home Manager**: Declarative management of user environments, applications, and dotfiles
- **70+ Makefile Commands**: Comprehensive system administration toolkit

### Key Features

#### 🎯 **Dotfiles Management & Synchronization**
All personal configurations are version-controlled, modular, and easily synchronized across multiple machines, providing a consistent experience everywhere.

#### 🛠️ **Curated Software & Configurations**
A carefully selected suite of software applications with a focus on development tools and terminal-based applications, including pre-configured Neovim environments and optimized command-line utilities.

#### ⚡ **Performance & Resource Optimization**
Designed to be lean and efficient, with optimized resource usage ensuring a fast and responsive desktop experience.

#### 🎨 **Visual Aesthetics & Theming**
A cohesive and visually appealing desktop with detailed theming for the window manager, terminal, editor, and applications. Fonts, colors, and layouts are all managed declaratively for a unified and polished look.

### Who Is This For?

This configuration is ideal if you:
- Are technically proficient and comfortable with the Nix ecosystem
- Value granular control over your system setup
- Want a reproducible environment that works identically across machines
- Appreciate the power of declarative configuration
- Are looking for a professional development environment optimized for modern AI-assisted workflows

**Don't worry if you're new to NixOS** — this manual will guide you through everything you need to know, from basic usage to advanced customization.

This manual is the single source of truth for working with this system. It is written for daily use and ongoing development.

## 1. Quick Start

### Common commands

```bash
make help
make sys-test
make sys-apply
```

### Recommended flow

```bash
make sys-test
make sys-apply
```

## 2. Repository structure

Top-level layout:

```
Dotfiles/
├── flake.nix
├── hosts/
├── modules/
├── resources/
├── Makefile
├── make/               # Módulos del Makefile
└── docs/               # Documentación y manual
```

Where to look:

- `hosts/`: machine-specific configuration
- `modules/`: reusable NixOS and Home Manager modules
- `resources/`: mutable configs and scripts (edited directly)
- `make/`: Makefile modules organized by category
- `docs/`: this manual and web documentation

## 3. Hosts and machines

Hosts live under `hosts/`. Each host has:

- `configuration.nix`
- `user.nix`
- `hardware-configuration.nix` (generated)

Example switch:

```bash
make sys-apply HOSTNAME=hydenix
```

## 4. Home Manager and modules

Home Manager is enabled in `hosts/hydenix/user.nix`. Custom modules are in `modules/hm`.

Key entry points:

- `modules/hm/default.nix` (imports all HM modules)
- `modules/system/` (system modules)

## 5. Mutable files (no rebuild after first apply)

Some configs are intended to be edited directly without rebuild:

- Keybinds: `resources/config/keybinds.conf`
- Scripts: `resources/scripts/*.sh`
- Kitty: `resources/config/kitty.conf`
- Monitors: `resources/config/monitors.conf`

After the first `make sys-apply`, edits in `resources/` take effect immediately (no rebuild).

## 6. Keybinds and scripts

Main keybinds are defined in:

```
resources/config/keybinds.conf
```

Script launcher reads from:

```
resources/scripts/
```

## 7. Waybar

Waybar is managed by upstream Hydenix/HyDE. Local overrides are intentionally disabled to keep theme integration intact.

## 8. Network diagnostics

Use the built-in diagnostics target:

```bash
make log-net
```

## 9. Updating and maintenance

Update inputs:

```bash
make upd-all
make sys-test
make sys-apply
```

Clean old generations:

```bash
make sys-gc
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

Common steps:

```bash
make log-err
make log-net
make sys-debug
```

## 11. Customization checklist

- Edit `resources/config/keybinds.conf`
- Add scripts in `resources/scripts/`
- Update terminal settings in `resources/config/kitty.conf`
- Update monitor layout in `resources/config/monitors.conf`

## 12. Glossary

- **Hydenix**: NixOS framework based on HyDE
- **HyDE**: upstream dotfiles for Hyprland
- **HM**: Home Manager
