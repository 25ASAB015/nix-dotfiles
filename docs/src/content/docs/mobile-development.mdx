# Mobile Development on NixOS

This module configures the environment for Mobile development using Expo, React Native, and Flutter.

## Tools Installed
- **Android Studio**: Managed via Nix (stable version from unstable channel).
- **Flutter**: Latest stable version.
- **Expo & EAS CLI**: Node.js based tools.
- **Watchman**: File watching service for hot reload.

## Configuration Details
- `ANDROID_HOME` is set to `~/Android/Sdk`.
- Android SDK tools and platform-tools are added to your `PATH`.
- `udev` rules are enabled for physical device debugging.
- Your user is added to `adbusers` and `kvm` groups.

## First Time Setup
1. Run `android-studio`.
2. Follow the setup wizard to install the SDK into `~/Android/Sdk`.
3. Run `flutter doctor` to verify the environment.

## Troubleshooting
- **KVM**: If the emulator doesn't start, ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS.
- **Licenses**: Licensed are automatically accepted in the Nix configuration for the SDK download, but you might need to run `flutter doctor --android-licenses`.
